This software is created as an experiment for my master class in Cyber Security. 
It can be used only for educational purposes and is an example how neural network anomaly detecteion can be optimized with random search hyper parameter optimization. 
The unsupervisedAd class performs random search to find the best learning parameters which are than used by trainBest class to fitt the network and serialize the best model using early stopping configuration rules.
